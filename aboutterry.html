                With our discreet customer relations <br> policy we don't even have

                Most of us have been online for over 10 years. 
                We can assist you with almost anything - keeping your
                servers secure, or keeping your high-traffic websites up and running smoothly.
                To make this possible, we run our own fully multi-homed backbone network (AS33837),
                 with the capacity needed both to handle large DDoS attacks and to provide excellent connectivity to customers
                with bandwidth utilization ranging from a few Mbps to several hundred. Will PGP fit here?</dd>
